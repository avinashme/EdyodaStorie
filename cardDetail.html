                        We have had an insight into<span class="detail-blue"> Artificial Intelligence</span>. Well, one of its subfields is machine 
                        learning and this introduction will help you get a fair idea of what a <span class="detail-blue">machine learning online course</span>machine learning online course holds.
                        To begin with, one must understand what machine learning is. Basically, it is a concept wherein a machine 
                        attempts to understand the structure of a data and fits that into models that people can understand and utilize.
                        While traditional forms of computing were all about solving problems using set instructions and data, machine
                        learning is all about computers utilizing data, training on it and using statistical data to output values.
                        Thus, in this way, the process of decision-making is automated for computers based on sample input data. 
                        Now that we know what Machine Learning is all about, it’s time to delve in a little deeper.

                    <h4 class="detail-h4">Types Of Machine Learning</h4>
                    <p>There are three types of Machine Learning, some of these may seem similar to what you’ve already studied 
                        in your<span class="detail-blue"> artificial intelligence course</span>. These are:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <h4><li>Supervised</li></h4>
                        <p class="detail-card-para">
                            With supervised learning, a computer is fed data which is labeled with its desired output. This helps the
                            algorithm to learn from these given inputs by comparing the actual output with the taught output so that
                            it is able to point out any errors. Thus, supervised learning is guided by labels.
                        </p>
                        <p class="detail-blank-para">hi</p>
                        <h4></h4>
                        <h4><li>Unsupervised</li></h4>
                        <p class="detail-card-para">
                            As evident from the name, unsupervised learning utilizes unlabeled data and it is left on the computer
                             to be able to find commonalities within the varied given data. Thus, the abundance of data under 
                             unsupervised learning makes it more valuable. With unsupervised learning, people get to see hidden 
                             patterns in data. You may offer large sets of complex and unorganized data to the machine and it may
                              be able to present it back to you in potentially meaningful ways. 
                        </p>

                        <h4><li>Reinforcement Learning</li></h4>
                        <p class="detail-card-para">
                            Reinforcement learning works the same way for machines as it does for humans. The algorithm or the 
                            agent of reinforcement learning actually learns from the environment and every time it performs correctly
                             it is rewarded and vice versa. In this case, a machine learns by the concept of maximizing rewards and 
                             minimizing penalties. Thus, this way the machine learns certain behavior patterns and suitable responses.

                    <h4 class="detail-h4"> Programming Languages</h4>
                    <p class="detail-card-para">Moving on, it is important to know what kind of programming languages should one be equipped with to be able to 
                        master machine learning. You can definitely take a <span class="detail-blue">programming languages course</span> for one of these.

                        Firstly, you need to consider your job requirements before you pick a programming language. The most preferred
                         programming language is Python which is followed by Java, then R and finally C++:
                    </p>

                    <h4>Python:</h4>
                    <p class="detail-card2">Python offers you a number of deep learning frameworks including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. Python is 
                        also a powerful and rather straightforward tool for processing and utilizing data for it has a readable syntax.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Java:</h4>
                    <p class="detail-card2">Next in line is Java which is pretty effective for enterprise programming and can be used for front-end desktop'
                        application development. This is especially suitable for those app developers who work on machine learning at 
                        an enterprise level. It is mostly used for network security, fraud detection and more.
                   </p>

                    <h4>R:</h4>
                    <p class="detail-card2">The increased interest in data science has led to R becoming one of the more popular languages for programmers
                        and is an open-source programming language used primarily for statistical computing. 
                   </p>

                    <h4>C++:</h4>
                    <p class="detail-card2">C++ is the most preferred language when it comes to building games or robot applications. It offers you an increase
                         in proficiency as well as control in language.
